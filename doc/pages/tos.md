Terms of Service
================

Section 1. 
----------
This document is overly broad to the point of obscenity. (Seriously, this is not a joke.)

The administrator is not a lawyer and as such will take any and all means required to protect himself and his website from lawyers. Anyone versed in legalese (or weaselese) is welcome to submit less draconian terms for review to <webmaster@singleforest.com>.

These terms really are scary. 

Section 2.
----------
By creating an account on this site you agree to all terms in this document which may be changed any time. All changes to this document are retroactive by default. You implicitly agree to any changes by continuing to use this site regardless of any notification. 

Section 3. 
----------
By using this site you can't sue anyone or anything related to this site, including the administration, for any damages.

Section 3b.
-----------
There are no guarantees this website will be available.

Section 4.
----------
Any content or user can be modified, removed, banned, or deleted any time for any reason. Appeal or refund of monies is by sole discretion of the administrator. 

Users who follow the rules are less likely to be banned.

Section 5. 
----------
Singleforest.com does not claim ownership (or responsibility) for any material submitted to the site. However, by submitting content to this site you grant Singleforest.com and any related enterprise non-exclusive right and license to do **anything** necessary to display or not display your content. 

This section is obscene but we are pretty sure it's perfectly legal. These terms mean we probably could sell a book with your stuff in it provided we attribute it to you. It's this broad because the administrator doesn't know legalese. If you want better terms, see Section 1.

Section 6.
----------
Privacy Policy

* Nothing is private from an administrator. Messages between users, your email (if you provide one), and your login provider are visible to them. 
* Your email and login provider shouldn't be public
* Messages between users should only be visible to yourself, the user you sent them to, and any administrator reading your mail.
* Website bugs might make this stuff visible. No guarantees this won't happen. 

Section 7.
----------
Singleforest.com and it's administrators are not responsible for any user-submitted material on this site. Terms of Service and other official site documents are not user-submitted.

Section A.
---------------
A for Absurd. This section is non-binding.

Any user that has not read this document forfeits their left kidney for sale on ebay with monies received to be used as desired for the administrator's sole benefit. 

Upon reading this document any user may request their kidney be returned if it has not already been sold.
