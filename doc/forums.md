Ideas
======
- Threads can't be locked
- Threads can be prevented from being raised to the top by sinking them. 
- Threads aren't sticky
- If a thread is causing problems: delete it or sink it.

Sunken Threads
--------------
Sunken threads don't get bumped when someone comments on it. This can be used to kill topics that don't need to be discussed anymore.

Lack of sticky threads
----------------------
Sticky threads aren't needed, if the forum needs rules, make a page and put the rules there. 

If you need a popular threads list, program something or make a page.

Deleted Threads
---------------
Shouldn't appear in listings. If you link directly to a deleted thread, show a notice as it why it was deleted.
