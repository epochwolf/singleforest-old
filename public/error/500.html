    <h1>Congratulations, you've found a bug!</h1>
    <p>
      The developer of this website thanks your profusely for finding yet 
      another mistake he's made. He can't do anything to help you right now but
      he'll get a maintenance ferret around to fixing it sooner or later.

    <h2>Technical Explanation</h2>
    <p class="disclaimer">For programmers. May contain insults or unexpected geekage.</p>
    <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="javascript:this.style.display='none'; document.getElementById('tech').style.display='block';" >I dare, show me</a>
    <div id="tech" style="display: none;">
    <p>The error return was HTTP 500.</p>
    <p>
      An uncaught exception was thrown. There are a few reasons this happens. 
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The front end web server threw a widget</li>
      <li>A bug in the code caused an unchecked exception</li>
      <li>Hacking was detected and a security exception was thrown</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Security exceptions are not caught so that they appear in the logs and
      to prevent the attacker (you) from knowing if invalid input actually 
      caused erroneous operation.

      If you didn't disable javascript on your browser you need to KILL your system administrator (or whoever make him do this). 
      Javascript is critical to this website even through the guy running it knows more about dating women (zip) than javascript.
